# SixthFormPygameProject
An unfinished Pinball python game using the Pygame library. I began working on this for my A-Level Computer Science assignment, didn't manage to finish it on time and never picked it up later. Got a B on it overall, so if you are a student or beginner programmer this could be a good example for some stuff for Python and Pygame. :)
